# hOS - The free, open source, cross-platform hacking simulation game.

![dependencies](https://david-dm.org/Bloodfallen/hOS.svg)

## 1. What is hOS?
hOS is a game I was inspired to develop. It is based heavily off the gameplay of both Hacknet and Hackmud, designed to be
cross platform, and run entirely on NodeJS, utilizing Electron.

## 2. How long will this take to develop?
To be honest, I don't know. I'm developing it in my spare time, and as of the time of this writing, the game is extremely basic.
It has a basic user interface, and the server literally just exists for the client to have sometime to connect to.

## 3. Will there be any story campaign?
Currently, thats my main priority after I have authentication set up. After it is, I want you to be able to go through and experience a story, a journey. Before any of that can happen, though, I have to get the REST set up.

## 4. What features will hOS have?
The hope is to include many features from that of Hacknet and Hackmud. I want UNIX based commands like Hackmud, but I also want
everything to be different. I want this to be unique, while still showing that it has inspiration.

## 5. What limitations does this project have due to its nature as a NodeJS/ElectronJS project?
Actually, quite a lot. Seeing as the entire game will have to be developed using web-based code, like HTML, JavaScript, and stuff like that, theres a lot I can't do, from what I know. Boot animations and things of that like are going to be really hard if not impossible to perform, though one day I hope I can find a workaround.

## 6. How can I help?
Easy. Clone this repository, help me make changes and add features, and submit pull requests. I could REALLY use all the help I can get, as this is no easy task to perform on my own. Just getting this far has taken me a few days, and its not been easy. If anyone can help make things nicer, then by all means, feel free to do so. I really could use help on the UI for the moment, as right now its super basic and uses the horribly laggy particles.js for its background. I could also use help with making lots of server side stuff, as well as a good story to put as the "campaign" to the game (please help with this, I'm HORRIBLE with narrative creativity). Basically, modify the hell out of this, change it, make it better, help develop it, if you have the time and any interest in this project.

## 7. How do I set this up in a development workspace?
Thats pretty easy. Clone the repo, run `npm init`, and wait for it to finish. From there, run `npm test` to run the game. Same process for the server, but its launch command is `node server`.

## 8. Is that.... the FTL: Faster Than Light main menu theme song?
Yeah, it is. I had a copy of it on hand and thats why its in use here. I'll change it, one day, if I find something better, and less copyrighted.

### Note to the developers of FTL:
If you don't want me to use your incredible music in this, please just message me. I'll remove it on the spot, or you can submit a pull request to get rid of it, your call, just please don't DMCA me, its not nice ;_;

Thanks for all your help, see you online :)
